Both Players start with the\n          same deck (think Chess); its optimized for better game theory/play.\n          Instead of the cards telling you what action to take, the player must\n          utilize their Will-Power as a resource and cast spells to perform\n          rituals that help build towards your victory. Scape is designed for\n          high competetive ceiling with a low learning floor. With Five ways to\n          achieve victory, it is up to the player to decide their fate. Which\n          Ancient will you choose to support?\n        </div>\n\n\n\n\n        <div className={\"Info_Title\"}>Why Scape was Created?</div>\n        <div className={\"Text\"}>\n             Scape was created because we felt like Magic was becoming too unstable and bloated. \n             \"I liked the core engine of Magic, but was tired of seeing the massive amount of capitalism canabalise the game.\"\n             Magic, Hearthstone, and most TCG(s) are just unstable by way of change due to market driven goals. \n             I wanted to rebuild an engine that was hyper competetive and could support complex, but fair gameplay without the need for a pay wall. \n             As we play-tested this game we realized just how much more efficient, complex, and overall fun Scape started to become. We found ourselves wanting to play Scape more than Magic.\n             Another incredible aspect of Scape is that, while the deck doesn't change, the rituals and actions do.\n             In other words: we will release new rituals to perform in the game as the development of the game progresses.\n             Instead of having a prerelease weekend for new cards; we will have release events for new Rituals.\n             we see Ritual based gameplay as the next evolution of competetive card games; Scape is what magic would be without capitalism driven development.\n             Scape is different. Its Free to build and play.\n             We hope to release a digital version of the game soon. \n\n\n        </div>\n\n\n\n\n\n        <div className={\"Info_Title\"}>How to Play</div>\n        <div>(the rules assume you are familiar with Magic)</div> \n        {this.displayVocab()}\n        <div className={\"Scroll\"}>{this.displayRules()}</div>\n        \n      </div>\n    );\n  }\n}\n\nexport default About;\n","import React from \"react\";\nimport \"./Media.css\";\nimport YouTube from 'react-youtube';\nimport Player from 'react-player';\nimport Intro from '../../res/Scape_Title_Screen.mov';\n\nclass Media extends React.Component {\n  constructor(props) {\n    super(props);\n    this.state = {\n      opts: {\n        height: 'auto',\n        width: 'auto',\n        playerVars: {\n          // https://developers.google.com/youtube/player_parameters\n          autoplay: 0,\n        }\n     \n    },\n  }\n}\n\n\n\n_onReady(e){\n  e.target.pauseVideo();\n}\n\n  render() {\n    return <div className={\"Media\"}>\n     { (this.props.type === \"youtube\")?\n      <YouTube videoId=\"2RlA0TP5dHY\" opts={this.state.opts} onReady={this._onReady} />:\n      (this.props.type === \"intro\")?\n        <Player  \n        url={Intro}\n        className='react-player'\n        playing = \"true\"\n        width='100%'\n        loop = \"true\"\n        height='100%'\n        />:\n        <Player  \n        url={this.props.url || Intro}\n        className='react-player'\n        playing = \"true\"\n        width='100%'\n        loop = \"true\"\n        height='100%'\n        />\n\n        \n         \n          \n       \n    \n    }\n      </div>;\n  }\n}\n\nexport default Media;\n","import being_one_image from \"./res/being_one.png\";\nimport being_two_image from \"./res/being_two.png\";\nimport being_three_image from \"./res/being_three.png\";\nimport being_four_image from \"./res/being_four.png\";\nimport being_five_image from \"./res/being_five.png\";\nimport being_flying_image from \"./res/being_flying.png\";\nimport  back_image from \"./res/scape_back_logo.png\";\nimport cancel_image from \"./res/cancel.png\";\nimport ignite_image from \"./res/ignite.png\";\nimport grow_image from \"./res/grow.png\";\nimport spike_image from \"./res/spike.png\";\nimport landscape_image from \"./res/landscape.png\";\nimport smoldering_volcano_image from \"./res/smoldering_volcanoe.png\";\nimport field_of_imagination_image from \"./res/field_of_imagination.png\";\nimport cavern_of_the_see_image from \"./res/cavern_of_the_see.png\";\nimport misty_isle_image from \"./res/misty_isle.png\";\nimport nest_of_swarm_image from \"./res/nest_of_swarm.png\";\n\n\n\nconst Cards = {\n\n\n    field_of_imagination: {\n        name: \"Field of Imagination\",\n        type: \"Ancient\",\n        power:0,\n        defense:0,\n        text: \"RECYCLE: Shuffle your hand into your deck and draw that many cards. \",\n        image: field_of_imagination_image,\n        rules_name: \"field_of_imagination\",\n        amount: 1,\n    },\n    cavern_of_the_see: {\n        name: \"Cavern of the See\",\n        type: \"Ancient\",\n        power:0,\n        defense:0,\n        text: \"Look at target players hand.
